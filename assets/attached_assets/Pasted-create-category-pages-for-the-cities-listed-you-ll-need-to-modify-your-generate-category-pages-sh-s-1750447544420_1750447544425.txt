create category pages for the cities listed, you'll need to modify your generate-category-pages.sh script to loop through the full list of cities and generate the corresponding HTML pages with the same structure as for London.

Here's how you can update your generate-category-pages.sh script:

#!/bin/bash
# Generate Category Pages Script for multiple cities
echo "Generating category pages for multiple cities..."
# Define categories and details
declare -A categories=(
    ["health-beauty"]="Health & Beauty"
    ["products-retail"]="Products & Retail"
    ["transport-travel"]="Transport & Travel"
    ["services-professional"]="Services & Professional"
    ["energy-utilities"]="Energy & Utilities"
    ["recycling-waste"]="Recycling & Waste Management"
    ["education-nonprofits"]="Education & Nonprofits"
)

Steps to Take:
Replace the content in your generate-category-pages.sh with the above code.
Run the script to generate the HTML pages for each city, replicating the same format as London.
Ensure your JavaScript and other functionalities support these new city pages.
This approach creates dynamic HTML pages for each category and city, ensuring that users have a similar experience across all locations.
